# Current situation
- Lacking platform for new or underground artists/circles, esp. in the Asia region
- The best option is bandcamp
-  Soundcloud is a terrible platform with the worst audio encoding imaginable

# Goal
- Provide support for lesser knowns artists, discography and xfds
- Copyright and trademark: Only xfds are allowed for upload, transformative works are under Fair Use

# Internal structure
- TBD
