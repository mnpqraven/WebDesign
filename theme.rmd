# Current situation
- Lacking platform for new or underground artists/circles, esp. in the Asia region
- The best option is bandcamp, but it's still very foreign for users outside of Euroupe and America
-  Soundcloud is a terrible platform with the worst audio encoding imaginable

# Goal
- Provide support for lesser knowns artists, discography and xfds
- Copyright and trademark: Only xfds are allowed for upload, transformative works are under Fair Use
  (xfds: Crossfades, 15-30 seconds snippet of a song/track)

# Internal structure
- TBD
