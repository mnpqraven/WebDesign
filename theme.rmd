# Current situation
- Lacking platform for new or underground artists/circles, esp. in the Asia region
- Countries like Japan still has very focused physical media platforms instead of digital, digital music platform, for example streaming is still extremely under-utilized
- The best option is bandcamp, but it's still very foreign for users outside of Europe and America
-  Soundcloud is a terrible platform with the worst audio encoding imaginable

# Goal
- Provide support for lesser knowns artists, discography and xfds
- Copyright and trademark: Only xfds are allowed for upload, transformative works are under Fair Use
- Link to the album/artist storepage for purchase


  (xfds: Crossfades, 15-30-second snippets of a song/track)

# Internal structure
- Metadata: currently by hand
  - Will be expanded into SQL Database in the future
- XFDs: offline server
# Site structure:
- Overall GUI examples:
  - \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{min}
\href{https://slipknot1.com}{Slipknot} for imemrsion and symmetrical design and
\href{http://muonofficial.com/new_discography/haku/}{舞音KAGURA} for presentation and more specific details
\end{CJK}
  - End result should be a sliding vertical pane of discography and horizontal presentation of details of each album
