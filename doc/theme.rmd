# Why
- Lacking platform for new or underground artists/circles, esp. in the Asia region
- Countries like Japan still has very focused physical media platforms instead of digital, digital music platform, for example streaming is still extremely under-utilized
- The best option is bandcamp, but it's still very foreign for users outside of Europe and America
-  Soundcloud is a terrible platform with the worst audio encoding imaginable (64kbps OPUS is **not** good)

# Goal
- Provide support for lesser known artists, discography and xfds
- Link to the album/artist storepage for purchase
- Copyright and trademark: Only xfds/metadata are allowed for upload by the maintainer/admin in this case, xfds are transformative works and fall under Fair Use


  (xfds: Crossfades, 15-30-second snippets of a song/track)
